## [中文文档](./README_CN.md)

I'm Chinese, and I'm not good at English, so I apologise for my translation.

## Introduction

PMail is a personal email server that pursues a minimal deployment process and extreme resource consumption. It runs on
a single file and contains complete send/receive mail service and web-side mail management functions. Just a server , a
domain name , a line of code , a minute of deployment time , you will be able to build a domain name mailbox of your
own .

All kinds of PR are welcome, whether you are fixing bugs, adding features, or optimizing translations. Also, call for a
beautiful and cute Logo for this project!

## Features

* Single file operation and easy deployment.
* The binary file is only 15MB and takes up less than 10M of memory during the run.
* Support dkim, spf checksum, [Email Test](https://www.mail-tester.com/) score 10 points if correctly configured.
* Implementing the ACME protocol, the program will automatically obtain and update Let's Encrypt certificates.

> By default, a ssl certificate is generated for the web service, allowing pages to use the https protocol.
> If you have your own gateway or don't need https, set `httpsEnabled` to `2` in the configuration file so that the web
> service will not use https.
> (Note: Even if you don't need https, please make sure the path to the ssl certificate file is correct, although the web
> service doesn't use the certificate anymore, the smtp protocol still needs the certificate)

* Support pop3, smtp protocol, you can use any mail client you like.
* Support multi-domain, multi-user and complete support for sending and receiving e-mail.


# How to run

## 0、Check You IP / Domain

First go to [spamhaus](https://check.spamhaus.org/) and check your domain name and server IP for blocking records

## 1、Download

* [Click Here](https://github.com/Jinnrry/PMail/releases) Download a program file that matches you.
* Or use Docker `docker pull ghcr.io/jinnrry/pmail:latest`

## 2、Run

`./pmail -p 80`

> -p Set the http port of the bootstrap setup interface, the default is port 80, note that this parameter only affects the bootstrap setup phase, if you need to change the port after setup is complete, please modify the configuration file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The SSL certificate will not be set automatically if the bootstrap setup phase uses a port other than 80.

Or

`docker run -p 25:25 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 110:110 -p 465:465 -p 995:995 -p 993:993 -v $(pwd)/config:/work/config ghcr.io/jinnrry/pmail:latest`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your server has a firewall turned on, you need to open ports 25, 80, 110, 443, 465, 993, 995

## 3、Configuration

Open `http://127.0.0.1` in your browser or use your server's public IP to visit, then follow the instructions to
configure.

## 4、Email Test

Check if your mailbox has completed all the security configuration. It is recommended to
use [https://www.mail-tester.com/](https://www.mail-tester.com/) for checking.
